          <p>The author of this page, Angie Volstad, first heard of the Beatles when her father showed her a movie, Yellow Submarine when she was very little. Sure, the flashy graphics and sequences might have been a lot to take in, but what really stuck with her for the rest of her life was the music. One of the songs in the movie, Nowhere Man, was unlike any song she heard before. After listening to so much 90's pop music in her early life, it was quite an enlightenment for her to hear music so spectacular from before she was born. The harmonies, the guitar runs, the flow itself completely captivated her. She went on to discover more of that glorious music and would later learn how huge an impact these four friends made on the world. With this site, she hopes other fans will appreciate her contribution to the fandom.</p>
