						<p>FAST FACTS!</p>
					</header>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/john_lennon.jpg" alt="" /></span>Born: Liverpool, England (October 9, 1940)<br>
					<br>He was raised by a single mother named Julia, after whom he had written a song.<br>
					<br>Died: New York City, New York (December 8, 1980; aged 40). He was shot in front of his home and in front of his wife, Yoko Ono, by a deranged fan named Mark David Chapman. He passed away after being brought to the hospital. In Central Park, the Strawberry Fields Memorial was created in his memory.<br>
					<br>His main position in the Beatles was co-founder, main vocalist, main songwriter,and rhythm guitarist.<br>
					His main instruments were the guitar, piano and harmonica.<br>
					<br>He married his first wife Cynthia in 1962. Their son Julian was born a year later. Their marriage lasted until 1968 when John fell in love with Yoko Ono. Together, they formed a rock group called the Plastic Ono band. John and Yoko's son, Sean, was born in 1975.<br>
					<br>He was a prominent, albeit sometimes controversial, figure of the 60's counterculture and peace movements.<br>
					<br>Although some critics claim that the song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, was a reference to drugs, the song was actually inspired by John's son Julian. Julian drew a picture of his nursery school mate, named Lucy O'Donnell, and showed it to his father, calling the drawing Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.<br>
					<br>Some of his solo hits include: "Happy Xmas (War is Over)", "Imagine", "Give Peace a Chance", and "Jealous Guy".
